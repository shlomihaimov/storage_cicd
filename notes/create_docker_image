*note u will have to install docker on your machine.

u will need to two critical files.
1. Dockerfile
   which is like a recppie to how to build the image from which base 
   with what user to use copy the and run the app, etc.
2. app
   some application to run.
   u can use multiple procces by just running an over all procces that willl run the   other proccess. looks something like this:
 
   # run as much proccess as u would like.
   ./proccess1 &
   ./proccess2 &
   # make the father proccess keep running
   while true
      time.sleep(1)
 
############
After creating evry thing u need to build the image its
time to buid it and run it.

build:
docker build -t <name_of_image> .

run:
docker run -d(make it work in the background)-it(make it work while ustiil on it) -p(open to the container port if needed for example 8080) <name_of_image>
