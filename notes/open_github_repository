In order to open git hub repository 
u will need to get to their site create a user.

start new repository give it a name.

* I dont remember how but u will have to create gpg keys and use them to make the connaction to your machine . (not sure this is neccery but if it doesnt work rember to do this step. there are plany of explantion online).

Then through your machine clone set repo
using:
git clone <url> <name of the client repo>

Do first commit and push check at github if the proccess was successfull
if yes start working with git hub as u will.
